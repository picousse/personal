  [Goal] Development of production process for HMO using novel production micro-organisms.
  I'm involved in:

  - planning and designing novel metabolic production pathways
  - identification and solving of pathway bottlenecks (theoretical: literature/databases/modeling and practical: UPLC/HPLC, genotyping, phenotyping)
  - bioinformatics: alternative genes / pathways (Galaxy, blast, ETE)
  - planning strain building: leading team towards efficient host construction
  - evaluation: from high throughput microtiter plate up to 5L fermentors
  - involved in process development: optimization and alignment of fermentation and DSP processes.

  - data capture: capturing lab data from operators and machines and store in databases (PostgreSQL, influxDB, neo4j)
  - data analysis: wrote several packages to help with data extraction and analysis (python3 and R)
  - data visualisation: wrote different R shiny apps helping with data visualisation (R Shiny, Grafana)
  - data tools: developed different webapps that talk to different databases and allow operators to modify the data using a webbrowser (python3, flask). Setup web tools like Rstudio, Jupyter and Galaxy.
  - setting up IT infrastructure (linux): LXD/LXC containers/Docker
