As young teenager I had three dreams:  working with DNA, working with computer's or designing buildings/being an architect.

Obviously, during my studies I focussed on the first thing, DNA a lot. 
Now, with about 10 years inside the bacterial biotech, I've covered quite a lot of ground. I've been reading and rewriting DNA, and not without results.

However, I came to a point where I was no longer satisfied in my professional life. Because of how my current employer was setup, little by little I've had less impact within the company, and the current job, became less and less why I had signed up for.
This was a natural evolution as I was one of the early employees, and was involved in close to everything. As the company grew, I could not grow with the company. Long story short, time to move on.

But, where to go to? I have more or less single-handedly build the intranet comprising several python tools and module and R packages. I've also build complete dataflows for experiments, from collecting data, storing and querying and analysing data.
By doing this, I've learned a lot of new technologies, and more importantly, I realised that old passion, working with computers/programming/... was not gone.

So I've tried to convince ML6 to get my on board. The selection process alone got me triggered as it required me to learn new skills: working with Google Cloud Platform.

But this blogpost is really on what I've learned at my time at Inbiose:

- I'm more of a people person then I realised. The jury is still if I'm a decent teamleader, however I really like to be one. I had the luxury to select and build my team, and to guide it for four and a half year. A story of mountains and valleys (wink wink), but mostly very proud.
- I've learned I value HR more then I ever thought I would. Having somewhat a path towards growth or respective is really important to keep everybody happy, but also efficient.
- Team athmosphere, for a teamlead, is 'createable'. Don't let it happen, but steer it in the right direction. On a individual level, i feel that three things are important: paycheck, challenges, and involvement/ownership. For every team member, the combination is different, but a lot can be done by challenging your team members.
- Openness and transparancy are really important for me.
