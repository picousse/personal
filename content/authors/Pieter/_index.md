Born as a true generalist, I choose to learn a lot about DNA/biology. I'm currently leading an R&D team
I'm a bio engineer, holding a PhD in metabolic engineering, covering the fields of synthetic and systems biology. This training thought me a lot on biology, project planning and analytical thinking.
Along the way I learned quite a bit of data(-engineering): data collection/storing data/extracting and parsing data/data visualisation. I know my way in R and python, (No)SQL databases, shiny, Flask, scheduler, kafka,...

I have an interest in data science, automation, robotics and sports.
